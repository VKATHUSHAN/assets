# Blockchain.zip File Status

## Question
"my blockchain.zip already inside the trustwallet repo ?"

## Answer
**No, there is no `blockchain.zip` file in the Trust Wallet assets repository.**

## Repository Structure Analysis

### What exists instead:
- **`blockchains/` directory**: Contains 183 individual blockchain subdirectories
- **Individual blockchain folders**: Each blockchain has its own directory with assets, info, and configuration files

### Search Results:
- No `.zip` files found anywhere in the repository
- The only blockchain-related files are:
  - `./blockchains/` (directory containing all blockchain data)
  - `./dapps/blockchaincuties.co.png` (a dApp logo file)

### Repository Organization:
The Trust Wallet assets repository is organized as:
```
blockchains/
├── bitcoin/
│   ├── assets/
│   └── info/
├── ethereum/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── info/
│   ├── tokenlist.json
│   ├── tokenlist-extended.json
│   ├── chainlist.json
│   └── validators/
├── [182 other blockchain directories...]
└── ...
```

## Conclusion
The repository stores blockchain data in expanded directory format rather than compressed archives. There is no `blockchain.zip` file present, and the `.gitignore` doesn't exclude zip files, so if it existed, it would be visible.

If you're looking for blockchain data, it's available in the `blockchains/` directory in an organized, uncompressed format.
